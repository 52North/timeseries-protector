## 52North's Timeseries Protector
The projectâ€™s aim is to define rules to restrict access to SOS contents on the operation and parameter level.This goal is achieved with a nice graphical user interface to enable the admin user to manage permissions for a particular enforcement point, which is the connection point for the client instead of the original SOS endpoint.

### Installation Instructions
Deploy the .war file of the project either by using the Tomcat's Manager App or use an IDE like Eclipse to unwrap the web archive for you

### Build the client
